To get help with a current project, view the details of the project(s) below to see what is needed. We'd love to have you join the build team, donate materials or funds. Some projects may have a link to an external site such as GoFundMe.com. To donate funds directly to a project, use the link on the project page. To donate to a general fund that will be distributed across projects, use the link below.

DONATE FUNDS

Lurkers and other audience-type activities are welcome on most projects. Check with the project owner to ensure space availability.

If you want to get involved in general community activities, there is always something to do.

# Write for the website
Interview project owners and participants during and after projects. Write case studies and project updates for publishing. <strong>Contact us</strong> for additional details on what would be required.

Write content or update other areas of the website. A familiarity with markdown is all that is needed to help here.

# Take photos
We are always in need of good photos for case studies, project updates and social media posts.  <strong>Contact us</strong> if you would like to join our photography team. Proper credit will be given for all photos.

# Host tours or events
Many times additional help is needed for tours of projects or other events. Our team of hosts provide support to Project Owners to ensure a great experience for all.

# Teach a class
We are always looking for instruction to add to our knowledge corner. If you would like to teach a class directly related to our project work, please <strong>let us know</strong>.
